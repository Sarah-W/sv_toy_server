Having done the coding challenge at https://github.com/springload/frontend-starter-kit/blob/main/docs/node-coding-test.md I decided to replicate it in Svelte, just to see how hard it would be. (Conclusion: Moderately, but I am a pretty novice back-end dev.)

This version does have a front end - mostly so I could get at the animal._id values in a really easy way. So, here it is, an API, with a really basic front end, not in React, but in Svelte.

It is deployed at https://sv-toy-server.vercel.app/
